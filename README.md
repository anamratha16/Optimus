This GitHub repository hosts our DAEN 690 Master's final project, dedicated to developing a comprehensive terrorism dashboard using GTTAC datasets. Our objective is to address specific research questions, leveraging data visualization and analytical techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into global terrorism activities. This interactive platform is designed to aid researchers, policymakers, and security experts in understanding the dynamics of terrorism, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning. Through this project, we aim to contribute significantly to the field of terrorism studies, enhancing the capabilities for monitoring, analysis, and response to terrorism worldwide.
